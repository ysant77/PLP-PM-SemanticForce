Risks\\nIf our security measures or those of our third-party data center hosting facilities, cloud computing platform providers or third-\\nparty service partners, or the underlying infrastructure of the Internet are breached, and unauthorized access is obtained to a\\ncustomer\\u2019s data, our data or our IT systems, or authorized access is blocked or disabled, our services may be perceived as not being\\nsecure, customers may curtail or stop using our services, and we may incur significant reputational harm, legal exposure and\\nliabilities, or a negative financial impact.\\nOur services involve the storage and transmission of our customers\\u2019 and our customers\\u2019 customers\\u2019 proprietary and other sensitive\\ndata, including financial, health and other personal information. While we have security measures in place to protect our customers\\u2019 and\\nour customers\\u2019 customers\\u2019 data, our services and underlying infrastructure may in the future be materially breached or compromised as\\na result of the following:\\n\\u2022 third-party attempts to fraudulently induce our employees, partners or customers to disclose sensitive information such as user\\nnames, passwords or other information to gain access to our customers\\u2019 data or IT systems, or our data or our IT systems;\\n\\u2022 efforts by individuals or groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, such as state-sponsored organizations or nation-\\nstates, to launch coordinated attacks, such as retaliatory cyber attacks stemming from Russia\\u2019s recent invasion of Ukraine,\\nincluding ransomware and distributed denial-of-service attacks;\\n\\u2022 third-party attempts to abuse our marketing, advertising, messaging or social products and functionalities to impersonate\\npersons or organizations and disseminate information that is false, misleading or malicious;\\n\\u2022 cyberattacks on our internally built infrastructure on which many of our service offerings operate, or on third-party cloud-\\ncomputing platform providers;\\n\\u2022 vulnerabilities resulting from enhancements and updates to our existing service offerings;\\n\\u2022 vulnerabilities in the products or components across the broad ecosystem that our services operate in conjunction with and are\\ndependent on;\\n\\u2022 vulnerabilities existing within new technologies and infrastructures, including those from acquired companies;\\n\\u2022 attacks on, or vulnerabilities in, the many different underlying networks and services that power the Internet that our products\\ndepend on, most of which are not under our control or the control of our vendors, partners or customers; and\\n\\u2022 employee or contractor errors or intentional acts that compromise our security systems.\\nThese risks are mitigated, to the extent possible, by our ability to maintain and improve business and data governance policies,\\nenhanced processes and internal security controls, including our ability to escalate and respond to known and potential risks. Our Board\\nof Directors, Cybersecurity Committee and executive management are regularly briefed on our cybersecurity policies and practices and\\nongoing efforts to improve security, as well as periodic updates on cybersecurity events. Although we have developed systems and\\nprocesses designed to protect our customers\\u2019 and our customers\\u2019 customers\\u2019 proprietary and other sensitive data, we can provide no\\nassurances that such measures will provide absolute security or that a material breach will not occur. For example, our ability to\\nmitigate these risks may be impacted by the following:\\n\\u2022 frequent changes to, and growth in complexity of, the techniques used to breach, obtain unauthorized access to, or sabotage IT\\nsystems and infrastructure, which are generally not recognized until launched against a target, and could result in our being\\nunable to anticipate or implement adequate measures to prevent such techniques;\\n\\u2022 the continued evolution of our internal IT systems as we early adopt new technologies and new ways of sharing data and\\ncommunicating internally and with partners and customers, which increases the complexity of our IT systems;\\n\\u2022 the acquisition of new companies, requiring us to incorporate and secure different or more complex IT environments;\\n\\u2022 authorization by our customers to third-party technology providers to access their customer data, which may lead to our\\ncustomers\\u2019 inability to protect their data that is stored on our servers; and\\n\\u2022 our limited control over our customers or third-party technology providers, or the processing of data by third-party technology\\nproviders, which may not allow us to maintain the integrity or security of such transmissions or processing.\\n12\\nTable of Contents\\nIn the normal course of business, we are and have been the target of malicious cyberattack attempts and have experienced other\\nsecurity incidents. To date, such identified security events have not been material or significant to us, including to our reputation or\\nbusiness operations, or had a material financial impact, but there can be no assurance that future cyberattacks will not be material or\\nsignificant. Additionally, as our market presence grows, we may face increased risks of cyberattack attempts or security threats.\\nA security breach or incident could result in unauthorized parties obtaining access to, or the denial of authorized access to, our IT\\nsystems or data, or our customers\\u2019 systems or data, including intellectual property and proprietary, sensitive or other confidential\\ninformation. A security breach could also result in a loss of confidence in the security of our services, damage our reputation, negatively\\nimpact our future sales, disrupt our business and lead to increases in insurance premiums and legal, regulatory and financial exposure\\nand liability. Finally, the detection, prevention and remediation of known or potential security vulnerabilities, including those arising\\nfrom third-party hardware or software, may result in additional financial burdens due to additional direct and indirect costs, such as\\nadditional infrastructure capacity spending to mitigate any system degradation and the reallocation of resources from development\\nactivities.\\nDefects or disruptions in our services could diminish demand for our services and subject us to substantial liability.\\nBecause our services are complex and incorporate a variety of hardware, proprietary software and third-party and open-source\\nsoftware, our services may have errors or defects that could result in unanticipated downtime for our subscribers and harm to our\\nreputation and our business. Our customers may also use our services in unanticipated ways that may cause a disruption in services for\\nother customers attempting to access their data. Cloud services frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new\\nversions or enhancements are released. We may also encounter difficulties integrating acquired technologies into our services and in\\naugmenting the technologies to meet the quality standards that are consistent with our brand and reputation. As a result, our services\\nmay have errors or defects resulting from the complexities of integrating acquisitions.\\nWe have from time to time found defects in, and experienced disruptions to, our services and new defects or disruptions may\\noccur in the future. Such defects could be the result of employee, contractor or other third-party acts or inaction, and could negatively\\naffect our brand and reputation. Defects in our products could create vulnerabilities that could inadvertently permit access to protected\\ncustomer data. For example, in December 2021, a vulnerability in a widely-used open-source software application, known as Apache\\nLog4j, was identified that could have allowed bad actors to remotely access a target, potentially stealing data or taking control of a\\ntarget\\u2019s system. We promptly worked to remediate vulnerabilities related to Apache Log4j in our internal systems and service offerings\\nwhile working with our vendors to ensure the same. While this issue did not materially affect our business, reputation or financial\\nresults, there is no assurance that such circumstances or other incidents could not occur in the future with a material adverse effect on\\nour business. Vulnerabilities in open source or any proprietary or third-party product can persist even after security patches have been\\nissued if customers have not installed the most recent updates, or if the attackers exploited the vulnerabilities before patching was\\ncomplete.\\nSince our customers use our services for important aspects of their business, any errors, defects, disruptions in service or other\\nperformance problems could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers\\u2019 businesses. As a result, customers could elect to not\\nrenew our services or delay or withhold payment to us. We could also lose future sales or customers may make warranty or other claims\\nagainst us, which could result in an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts, an increase in collection cycles for accounts\\nreceivable or the expense and risk of litigation.\\nAny interruptions or delays in services from third parties, including data center hosting facilities, cloud computing platform\\nproviders and other hardware and software vendors, or from our inability to adequately plan for and manage service interruptions\\nor infrastructure capacity requirements, could impair the delivery of our services and harm our business.\\nWe currently serve our customers from third-party data center hosting facilities and cloud computing platform providers located in\\nthe United States and other countries. We also rely on computer hardware purchased or leased from, software licensed from, and cloud\\ncomputing platforms provided by, third parties in order to offer our services, including database software, hardware and data from a\\nvariety of vendors. Any disruption or damage to, or failure of our systems generally, including the systems of our third-party platform\\nproviders, could result in interruptions in our services. We have from time to time experienced interruptions in our services and such\\ninterruptions may occur in the future. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted and continues to disrupt the supply chain of\\nhardware needed to maintain these third-party systems or to run our business, which affects our and our suppliers\\u2019 operations. In\\naddition, supply chain disruptions due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and any indirect effects may further complicate existing\\nsupply chain constraints. As we increase our reliance on these third-party systems, particularly with respect to third-party cloud\\ncomputing platforms, our exposure to damage from service interruptions may increase. Interruptions in our services may cause us to\\nissue credits or pay penalties, cause customers to make warranty or other claims against us or to terminate their subscriptions, and\\nadversely affect our attrition rates and our ability to attract new customers, all of which would reduce our revenue. Our business and\\nreputation would also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our services are unreliable.\\n13\\nTable of Contents\\nFor many of our offerings, our production environment and customers\\u2019 data are replicated in near real time in a separate facility\\nlocated elsewhere. Certain offerings, including some offerings of companies added through acquisitions, may be served through\\nalternate facilities or arrangements. We do not control the operation of any of these facilities, and they may be vulnerable to damage or\\ninterruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events. They may also be subject to\\nbreak-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct, as well as local administrative actions (including shelter-in-\\nplace or similar orders), changes to legal or permitting requirements and litigation to stop, limit or delay operation. Despite precautions\\ntaken at these facilities, such as disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements, the occurrence of a natural disaster or public\\nhealth emergency (including the COVID-19 pandemic), an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or\\nother unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our services.\\nThese hardware, software, data and cloud computing platforms may not continue to be available at reasonable prices, on\\ncommercially reasonable terms or at all. Any loss of the right to use any of these hardware, software or cloud computing platforms\\ncould significantly increase our expenses and otherwise result in delays in the provisioning of our services until equivalent technology\\nis either developed by us, or, if available, is identified, obtained through purchase or license and integrated into our services.\\nIf we do not accurately plan for our infrastructure capacity requirements and we experience significant strains on our data center\\ncapacity, our customers could experience performance degradation or service outages that may subject us to financial liabilities, result\\nin customer losses and harm our reputation and business. As we add data centers and capacity and continue to move to cloud computing\\nplatform providers, we may move or transfer our data and our customers\\u2019 data. Despite precautions taken during this process, any\\nunsuccessful data transfers may impair the delivery of our services, which may damage our business.\\nAs we acquire and invest in companies or technologies, we may not realize the expected business or financial benefits and the\\nacquisitions could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating\\nresults and the market value of our common stock.\\nAs part of our business strategy, we periodically make investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, joint\\nventures, services and technologies and intellectual property rights. We continue to evaluate such opportunities and expect to continue\\nto make such investments and acquisitions in the future.\\nAcquisitions and other transactions, arrangements and investments involve numerous risks and could create unforeseen operating\\ndifficulties and expenditures, including:\\n\\u2022 potential failure to achieve the expected benefits on a timely basis or at all;\\n\\u2022 potential identified or unknown security vulnerabilities in acquired products that expose us to additional security risks or delay\\nour ability to integrate the product into our service offerings;\\n\\u2022 difficulties in increasing or maintaining the security standards for acquired technology consistent with our other services, and\\nrelated costs;\\n\\u2022 difficulty of transitioning the acquired technology onto our existing platforms and customer acceptance of multiple platforms\\non a temporary or permanent basis;\\n\\u2022 augmenting the acquired technologies and platforms to the levels that are consistent with our brand and reputation;\\n\\u2022 brand or reputational harm associated with our strategic investments or acquired companies;\\n\\u2022 challenges converting the acquired company\\u2019s revenue recognition policies and forecasting the related revenues, including\\nsubscription-based revenues and software license revenue, as well as appropriate allocation of the customer consideration to\\nthe individual deliverables;\\n\\u2022 diversion of financial and managerial resources from existing operations;\\n\\u2022 the potential entry into new markets in which we have little or no experience or where competitors may have stronger market\\npositions;\\n\\u2022 currency and regulatory risks associated with foreign countries and potential additional cybersecurity and compliance risks\\nresulting from entry into new markets;\\n\\u2022 difficulties in integrating acquired operations, technologies, services, platforms and personnel;\\n\\u2022 regulatory challenges from antitrust or other regulatory authorities that may block, delay or impose conditions (such as\\ndivestitures, ownership or operational restrictions or other structural remedies) on the completion of transactions or the\\nintegration of acquired operations;\\n\\u2022 failure to fully assimilate, integrate or retrain acquired employees, which may lead to retention risk with respect to both key\\nacquired employees and our existing key employees or disruption to existing teams;\\n\\u2022 differences between our values and those of our acquired companies, as well as disruptions to our workplace culture;\\n14\\nTable of Contents\\n\\u2022 inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition or investment costs;\\n\\u2022 challenges with the acquired company\\u2019s customers and partners, including the inability to maintain such relationships and\\nchanges to perception of the acquired business as a result of the acquisition;\\n\\u2022 challenges with the acquired company\\u2019s third-party service providers, including those that are required for ongoing access to\\nthird-party data;\\n\\u2022 potential for acquired products to impact the profitability of existing products;\\n\\u2022 unanticipated expenses related to acquired technology and its integration into our existing technology;\\n\\u2022 known and potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired businesses, including due to litigation;\\n\\u2022 difficulties in managing, or potential write-offs of, acquired assets or investments, and potential financial and credit risks\\nassociated with acquired customers;\\n\\u2022 negative impact to our results of operations because of the depreciation and amortization of acquired intangible assets, fixed\\nassets and operating lease right-of-use assets;\\n\\u2022 the loss of acquired unearned revenue and unbilled unearned revenue;\\n\\u2022 challenges relating to the structure of an investment, such as governance, accountability and decision-making conflicts that\\nmay arise in the context of a joint venture or other majority ownership investments;\\n\\u2022 difficulties in and financial costs of addressing acquired compensation structures inconsistent with our compensation structure;\\n\\u2022 additional stock-based compensation issued or assumed in connection with the acquisition, including the impact on\\nstockholder dilution and our results of operations;\\n\\u2022 delays in customer purchases due to uncertainty related to any acquisition;\\n\\u2022 ineffective or inadequate controls, procedures and policies at the acquired company;\\n\\u2022 in the case of foreign acquisitions, challenges caused by integrating operations over distance, and across different languages,\\ncultures and political environments; and\\n\\u2022 the tax effects of any such acquisitions including related integration and business operation changes, and assessment of the\\nimpact on the realizability of our future tax assets or liabilities.\\nAny of these risks could harm our business or negatively impact our results of operations. In addition, to facilitate acquisitions or\\ninvestments, we may seek additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all, which may\\naffect our ability to complete subsequent acquisitions or investments, and which may affect the risks of owning our common stock. For\\nexample, if we finance acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible or other debt securities or loans, our existing stockholders may be\\ndiluted, or we could face constraints related to the terms of, and repayment obligation related to, the incurrence of indebtedness that\\ncould affect the market price of our common stock.\\nOur ability to acquire other businesses or technologies, make strategic investments or integrate acquired businesses effectively\\nmay be impaired by trade tensions and increased global scrutiny of foreign investments and acquisitions and investments in the\\ntechnology sector. For example, several countries, including the U.S. and countries in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, are\\nconsidering or have adopted restrictions of varying kinds on transactions involving foreign investments. Antitrust authorities in a\\nnumber of countries have also reviewed acquisitions and investments in the technology industry with increased scrutiny. Governments\\nmay continue to adopt or tighten restrictions of this nature, some of which may apply to acquisitions, investments or integrations of\\nbusinesses by us, and such restrictions or government actions could negatively impact our business and financial results.\\nWe may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the Slack acquisition, and the integration and benefits of the acquisition\\nmay take longer to realize than expected.\\nIn fiscal 2022, we completed the acquisition of Slack, our largest acquisition to date. We believe that there are significant benefits\\nand synergies that may be realized through combining the products, scale and combined enterprise customer bases of Salesforce and\\nSlack. However, the efforts to realize these benefits and synergies will be a complex process and may disrupt both companies\\u2019 existing\\noperations if not implemented in a timely and efficient manner. We are devoting significant attention and resources to successfully align\\nthe business practices and operations of Salesforce and Slack. This process may disrupt the businesses and, if ineffective, could limit\\nthe anticipated benefits of the acquisition. The full benefits of the acquisition, including the anticipated sales or growth opportunities,\\nmay not be realized or achieved within the anticipated time frame. Failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition could\\nadversely affect our results of operations or cash flows, cause dilution to our earnings per share, decrease or delay any accretive effect\\nof the acquisition and negatively impact the price of our common stock.\\n15\\nTable of Contents\\nSupporting our existing and growing customer base could strain our personnel resources and infrastructure, and if we are\\nunable to scale our operations and increase productivity, we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan.\\nWe continue to experience significant growth in our customer base and personnel, particularly through acquisitions, which has\\nplaced a strain on and in the future may stress the capabilities of our management, administrative, operational and financial\\ninfrastructure. We anticipate that significant additional investments will be required to scale our operations and increase productivity, to\\naddress the needs of our customers, to further develop and enhance our services, to expand into new geographic areas, and to scale with\\nour overall growth. The additional investments we are making will increase our cost base, which will make it more difficult for us to\\noffset any future revenue shortfalls by reducing expenses in the short term. We may not be able to make these investments as quickly or\\neffectively as necessary to successfully scale our operations.\\nWe regularly upgrade or replace our various software systems and processes. If the implementations of these new applications are\\ndelayed, or if we encounter unforeseen problems with our new systems and processes or in migrating away from our existing systems\\nand processes, our operations and our ability to manage our business could be negatively impacted. For example, our efforts to further\\nautomate our processes for customer contracts may be complicated by unanticipated operating difficulties.\\nOur success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to manage our projected growth effectively. To do so,\\nwe must continue to increase the productivity of our existing employees and to hire, train and manage new employees as needed.\\nAdditionally, changes in our work environment and workforce in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic could adversely affect our\\noperations. In particular, although most of our offices have reopened, we have offered a significant percentage of our employees the\\nflexibility in the amount of time they work in an office. Our new office model and any adjustments made to our current and future\\noffice environments or work-from-home policies may not meet the needs and expectations of our workforce, which could negatively\\nimpact our ability to attract and retain our employees. To manage the expected domestic and international growth of our operations and\\npersonnel, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, our reporting systems and\\nprocedures, and our utilization of real estate. If we fail to successfully scale our operations and increase productivity, we may be unable\\nto execute our business plan and the value of our common stock could decline.\\nIf our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our services or if they reduce the number of paying subscriptions at the\\ntime of renewal, our revenue and current remaining performance obligation could decline and our business may suffer. If we\\ncannot accurately predict subscription renewals or upgrade rates, we may not meet our revenue targets, which may adversely affect\\nthe market price of our common stock.\\nOur customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our services after the expiration of their contractual subscription\\nperiod, which is typically 12 to 36 months, and in the normal course of business, some customers have elected not to renew. In addition,\\nour customers may renew for fewer subscriptions, renew for shorter contract lengths, or switch to lower cost offerings of our services. It\\nis difficult to predict attrition rates given our varied customer base and the number of multi-year subscription contracts. Historically, our\\nsubscription and support revenues primarily consisted of subscription fees; however, with the 2018 acquisition of MuleSoft and the\\n2019 acquisition of Tableau, subscription and support revenues also now include term software license sales. We have less experience\\nforecasting the renewal rates of such term software license sales. Our attrition rates may increase or fluctuate as a result of various\\nfactors, including customer dissatisfaction with our services, customers\\u2019 spending levels, mix of customer base, decreases in the number\\nof users at our customers, competition, pricing increases or changes and deteriorating general economic conditions.\\nOur future success also depends in part on our ability to sell additional features and services, more subscriptions or enhanced\\neditions of our services to our current customers. This may also require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts that are\\ntargeted at senior management. Similarly, the rate at which our customers purchase new or enhanced services depends on a number of\\nfactors, including general economic conditions and customer receptiveness to any price changes related to these additional features and\\nservices.\\nIf customers do not renew their subscriptions, do not purchase additional features or enhanced subscriptions or if attrition rates\\nincrease, our business could be harmed.\\nPeriodic changes to our sales organization can be disruptive and may reduce our rate of growth.\\nWe periodically change and make adjustments to our sales organization in response to market opportunities, competitive threats,\\nmanagement changes, product introductions or enhancements, acquisitions, sales performance, increases in sales headcount, cost levels\\nand other internal and external considerations. Such sales organization changes have in some periods resulted in, and may in the future\\nresult in, a reduction of productivity, which could negatively impact our rate of growth in the current and future quarters and operating\\nresults, including revenue. In addition, any significant change to the way we structure our compensation of our sales organization may\\nbe disruptive and may affect our revenue growth.\\n16\\nTable of Contents\\nOur ability to deliver our services is dependent on the development and maintenance of the infrastructure of the Internet by\\nthird parties.\\nThe Internet\\u2019s infrastructure comprises many different networks and services that are highly fragmented and distributed by design.\\nThis infrastructure is run by a series of independent third-party organizations that work together to provide the infrastructure and\\nsupporting services of the Internet under the governance of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Numbers and Names (\\u201cICANN\\u201d) and\\nthe Internet Assigned Numbers Authority, now under the stewardship of ICANN.\\nThe Internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damages to portions of its infrastructure, denial-\\nof-service attacks or related cyber incidents, and it could face outages and delays in the future, potentially reducing the availability of\\nthe Internet to us or our customers for delivery of our Internet-based services. Any resulting interruptions in our services or the ability\\nof our customers to access our services could result in a loss of potential or existing customers and harm our business.\\nIn addition, certain countries have implemented, or may implement, legislative and technological actions that either do or can\\neffectively regulate access to the Internet, including the ability of Internet service providers to limit access to specific websites or\\ncontent. Other countries have attempted or are attempting to change or limit the legal protections available to businesses that depend on\\nthe Internet for the delivery of their services. These actions could potentially limit or interrupt access to our services from certain\\ncountries or Internet service providers, increase our risk or add liabilities, impede our growth, productivity and operational\\neffectiveness, result in the loss of potential or existing customers and harm our business.\\nSales to customers outside the United States expose us to risks inherent in international operations.\\nWe sell our services throughout the world and are subject to risks and challenges associated with international business. We intend\\nto continue to expand our international sales efforts. The risks and challenges associated with sales to customers outside the United\\nStates or those that can affect international operations generally, include:\\n\\u2022 natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism, and actual or threatened public health emergencies, including the ongoing COVID-19\\npandemic and related public health measures and resulting changes to laws and regulations, including changes oriented toward\\nprotecting local businesses or restricting the movement of people;\\n\\u2022 localization of our services, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses;\\n\\u2022 regulatory frameworks or business practices favoring local competitors;\\n\\u2022 pressure on the creditworthiness of sovereign nations, where we have customers and a balance of our cash, cash equivalents\\nand marketable securities;\\n\\u2022 foreign currency fluctuations and controls, which may make our services more expensive for international customers and\\ncould add volatility to our operating results;\\n\\u2022 compliance with multiple, conflicting, ambiguous or evolving governmental laws and regulations, including employment, tax,\\nprivacy, anti-corruption, import/export, customs, anti-boycott, sanctions and embargoes, antitrust, data transfer, storage and\\nprotection, and industry-specific laws and regulations, including rules related to compliance by our third-party resellers and\\nour ability to identify and respond timely to compliance issues when they occur;\\n\\u2022 liquidity issues or political actions by sovereign nations, including nations with a controlled currency environment, which\\ncould result in decreased values of these balances or potential difficulties protecting our foreign assets or satisfying local\\nobligations;\\n\\u2022 vetting and monitoring our third-party resellers in new and evolving markets to confirm they maintain standards consistent\\nwith our brand and reputation;\\n\\u2022 treatment of revenue from international sources, evolving domestic and international tax environments, and changes to tax\\ncodes, including being subject to foreign tax laws and being liable for paying withholding taxes in foreign jurisdictions;\\n\\u2022 impacts of or uncertainties regarding the United Kingdom\\u2019s exit from the EU (\\u201cBrexit\\u201d) on regulations, currencies, taxes and\\noperations, including possible disruptions to the sale of our services or the movement of our people between the United\\nKingdom, EU and other locations;\\n\\u2022 uncertainty regarding the imposition of and changes in the United States\\u2019 and other governments\\u2019 trade regulations, trade wars,\\ntariffs, other restrictions or other geopolitical events, including the evolving relations between the United States and China, the\\nUnited States and Russia and the recent Russian invasion of Ukraine;\\n\\u2022 changes in the public perception of governments in the regions where we operate or plan to operate;\\n\\u2022 regional data privacy laws and other regulatory requirements that apply to outsourced service providers and to the transmission\\nof our customers\\u2019 data across international borders, which grow more complex as we scale, expand into new markets and\\nenhance the breadth of our service offerings;\\n\\u2022 different pricing environments;\\n17\\nTable of Contents\\n\\u2022 difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\\n\\u2022 different or lesser protection of our intellectual property, including increased risk of theft of our proprietary technology and\\nother intellectual property;\\n\\u2022 longer accounts receivable payment cycles and other collection difficulties; and\\n\\u2022 regional economic and political conditions.\\nAny of these factors could negatively impact our business and results of operations. The above factors may also negatively impact\\nour ability to successfully expand into emerging market countries, where we have little or no operating experience, where it can be\\ncostly and challenging to establish and maintain operations, including hiring and managing required personnel, and difficult to promote\\nour brand, and where we may not benefit from any first-to-market advantage or otherwise succeed.\\nAs more of our sales efforts are targeted at larger enterprise customers, our sales cycle may become more time-consuming and\\nexpensive, we may encounter pricing pressure and implementation and configuration challenges, and we may have to delay revenue\\nrecognition for some complex transactions, all of which could harm our business and operating results.\\nAs we target more of our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers, including governmental entities, we may face greater costs,\\nlonger sales cycles, greater competition and less predictability in completing some of our sales. In this market segment, the customer\\u2019s\\ndecision to use our services may be an enterprise-wide decision and, if so, may require us to provide greater levels of education\\nregarding the use and benefits of our services, as well as addressing concerns regarding privacy and data protection laws and\\nregulations of prospective customers with international operations or whose own customers operate internationally.\\nIn addition, larger customers and governmental entities may demand more configuration, integration services and features. As a\\nresult of these factors, these sales opportunities may require us to devote greater sales support and professional services resources to\\nindividual customers, driving up costs and time required to complete sales and diverting our own sales and professional services\\nresources to a smaller number of larger transactions, while potentially requiring us to delay revenue recognition on some of these\\ntransactions until the technical or implementation requirements have been met.\\nPricing and packaging strategies for enterprise and other customers for subscriptions to our existing and future service offerings\\nmay not be widely accepted by other new or existing customers. Our adoption of such new pricing and packaging strategies may harm\\nour business.\\nFor large enterprise customers, professional services may also be performed by us, a third party, or a combination of our own staff\\nand a third party. Our strategy is to work with third parties to increase the breadth of capability and depth of capacity for delivery of\\nthese services to our customers. If a customer is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or a third party or with the type\\nof services or solutions delivered, we could incur additional costs to address the situation, the profitability of that work might be\\nimpaired, and the customer\\u2019s dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that customer. In\\naddition, negative publicity related to our customer relationships, regardless of its accuracy, may further damage our business by\\naffecting our ability to compete for new business with current or prospective customers.\\nWe may lose key members of our management team or development and operations personnel, and may be unable to attract\\nand retain employees we need to support our operations and growth.\\nOur success depends substantially upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key members of management,\\nparticularly our co-chief executive officers. From time to time, there may be changes in our management team resulting from the hiring,\\ndeparture or realignment of executives, and such changes may be disruptive to our business. We are also substantially dependent on the\\ncontinued service of our existing development and operations personnel because of the complexity of our services and technologies.\\nOur executive officers, key management, development or operations personnel could terminate their employment with us at any time.\\nThe loss of one or more of our key employees or groups of employees could seriously harm our business.\\nThe technology industry is subject to substantial and continuous competition for engineers with high levels of experience in\\ndesigning, developing and managing software and Internet-related services, as well as competition for sales executives, data scientists\\nand operations personnel. We have experienced, and currently experience, challenges with significant competition in talent recruitment\\nand retention, and may not in the future be successful in recruiting or retaining talent or achieving the workforce diversity goals we\\nhave set publicly. We have from time to time experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring, developing,\\nintegrating and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. These difficulties may be amplified by evolving\\nrestrictions on immigration, travel, or availability of visas for skilled technology workers. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to\\nretain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed.\\n18\\n\\nTable of Contents\\nIn addition, we believe in the importance of our corporate culture, which fosters dialogue, collaboration, recognition, equality and\\na sense of family. As our organization grows and expands globally, and as employees\\u2019 workplace expectations develop, we may find it\\nincreasingly difficult to maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture globally. These difficulties may be further amplified by\\nwork-from-home requirements imposed and other workforce actions taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our inability to\\nmaintain our corporate culture could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain employees, harm our reputation with customers,\\nor negatively impact our future growth.\\nAny failure in our delivery of high-quality professional and technical support services may adversely affect our relationships\\nwith our customers and our financial results.\\nOur customers depend on our support organization to resolve technical issues relating to our applications. We may be unable to\\nrespond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for support services across our varying and diverse\\nofferings. Outsourced provision of technical support may be suddenly and adversely impacted by unforeseen events, for example, as\\noccurred when certain business process outsourced service providers were delayed in effectively servicing our customers due to\\nconditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Increased customer demand for these services, without corresponding revenues, could\\nincrease costs and adversely affect our operating results. In addition, our sales process is highly dependent on our applications and\\nbusiness reputation and on positive recommendations from our existing customers. Any failure to maintain high-quality technical\\nsupport, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support, could adversely affect our reputation, our ability to sell\\nour service offerings to existing and prospective customers, and our business, operating results and financial position.\\nStrategic and Industry Risks\\nThe markets in which we participate are intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could\\nbe harmed.\\nThe market for enterprise applications and platform services is highly competitive, rapidly evolving, fragmented and subject to\\nchanging technology, low barriers to entry, shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services. Many\\nprospective customers have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to implement and integrate their current enterprise\\nsoftware into their businesses and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate away from their current solution to an enterprise\\ncloud computing application service. Additionally, third-party developers may be reluctant to build application services on our platform\\nsince they have invested in other competing technology platforms.\\nOur current competitors include:\\n\\u2022 internally developed enterprise applications by our current and potential customers\\u2019 IT departments;\\n\\u2022 vendors of packaged business software, as well as companies offering enterprise apps delivered through on-premises offerings\\nfrom enterprise software application vendors and cloud computing application service providers, either individually or with\\nothers;\\n\\u2022 software companies that provide their product or service free of charge as a single product or when bundled with other offerings,\\nor only charge a premium for advanced features and functionality, as well as companies that offer solutions that are sold without\\na direct sales organization;\\n\\u2022 vendors who offer software tailored to specific services as opposed to our full suite of service offerings;\\n\\u2022 suppliers of traditional business intelligence and data preparation products, as well as business analytics software companies;\\n\\u2022 integration software vendors and other companies offering integration or API solutions;\\n\\u2022 marketing vendors, which may specialize in advertising, targeting, messaging, or campaign automation;\\n\\u2022 e-commerce solutions from established and emerging cloud-only vendors and established on-premises vendors;\\n\\u2022 productivity tool and email providers, unified communications providers and consumer application companies that have entered\\nthe business software market; and\\n\\u2022 traditional platform development environment companies and cloud computing development platform companies who may\\ndevelop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new apps that run on the customers\\u2019 current infrastructure or as\\nhosted services.\\nIn addition, we may face more competition as we expand our product offerings. Some of our current and potential competitors\\nmay have competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories, more significant installed bases,\\nbroader geographic scope, broader suites of service offerings and larger marketing budgets, as well as substantially greater financial,\\ntechnical, personnel and other resources. In addition, many of our current and potential competitors have established marketing\\nrelationships and access to larger customer bases, and have major distribution agreements with consultants, system integrators and\\nresellers. We also experience competition from smaller, younger competitors that may be more agile in responding to customers\\u2019\\ndemands. These competitors may be able to respond more\\n19\\nTable of Contents\\nquickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements, or provide\\ncompetitive pricing, more flexible contracts or faster implementations. As a result, even if our services are more effective than the\\nproducts and services that our competitors offer, potential customers might select competitive products and services in lieu of\\npurchasing our services. For all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future\\ncompetitors, which could negatively impact our future sales and harm our business.\\nOur efforts to expand our service offerings and to develop and integrate our existing services in order to keep pace with\\ntechnological developments may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate and harm our business.\\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenue from subscriptions to our CRM enterprise cloud computing application services,\\nand we expect this will continue for the foreseeable future. Our efforts to expand our current service offerings may not succeed and may\\nreduce our revenue growth rate. In addition, the markets for certain of our offerings remain relatively new and it is uncertain whether\\nour efforts, and related investments, will ever result in significant revenue for us. Further, the introduction of significant platform\\nchanges and upgrades may not result in long term revenue growth.\\nIn July 2021, we completed our acquisition of Slack, our largest acquisition to date. Slack is a relatively new category of business\\ntechnology in a rapidly evolving market for software, programs and tools used by knowledge workers that is subject to rapidly\\nchanging technology, shifting user and customer needs, new and established market entrants, and frequent introductions of new\\nproducts and services. The success of Slack as a service offering will depend on adding new users and organizations, converting users\\nof the free version into paid customers, expanding usage within current customers, and selling premium subscription plans. Our ability\\nto attract new users and organizations and increase revenue from existing paid customers will depend in large part on our ability to\\ncontinually enhance and improve the features, integrations and capabilities that Slack offers, and to effectively introduce compelling\\nnew features, integrations and capabilities that reflect or anticipate the changing nature of the market in order to maintain and improve\\nthe quality and value of Slack.\\nIf we are unable to develop enhancements to, and new features for, our existing or new services that keep pace with rapid\\ntechnological developments, our business could be harmed. For example, we may be required to continuously enhance our artificial\\nintelligence offerings to improve the quality of recommendations provided to our customers. The success of enhancements, new\\nfeatures and services depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction and market acceptance of the feature,\\nservice or enhancement by customers, administrators and developers, as well as our ability to seamlessly integrate all of our product\\nand service offerings and develop adequate selling capabilities in new markets. Failure in this regard may significantly impair our\\nrevenue growth as well as negatively impact our operating results if the additional costs are not offset by additional revenues. In\\naddition, because our services are designed to operate over various network technologies and on a variety of mobile devices, operating\\nsystems and computer hardware and software platforms using a standard browser, we will need to continuously modify and enhance\\nour services to keep pace with changes in Internet-related hardware, software, communication, browser, app development platform and\\ndatabase technologies, as well as continue to maintain and support our services on legacy systems. We may not be successful in either\\ndeveloping these modifications and enhancements or in bringing them to market timely.\\nAdditionally, if we fail to anticipate or identify significant Internet-related and other technology trends and developments early\\nenough, or if we do not devote appropriate resources to adapting to such trends and developments, our business could be harmed.\\nUncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies, modifications to existing platforms or\\ntechnologies, including text messaging capabilities, or changes in customer usage patterns thereof could increase our research and\\ndevelopment or service delivery expenses or lead to our increased reliance on certain vendors. Any failure of our services to operate\\neffectively with future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our services, result in customer dissatisfaction\\nand harm our business.\\nOur continued success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brands.\\nWe believe that the brand identities we have developed, including associations with trust, customer success, innovation and\\nequality, have significantly contributed to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing the Salesforce brand and our other\\nbrands are critical to expanding our base of customers, partners and employees. Our brand strength, particularly for our core services,\\nwill depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to provide high-quality innovative products, services and\\nfeatures in a secure, reliable manner that enhances our customers\\u2019 success even as we scale and expand our services. In order to\\nmaintain and enhance the strength of our brands, we may make substantial investments to expand or improve our product offerings and\\nservices or enter new markets that may be accompanied by initial complications or ultimately prove to be unsuccessful.\\nIn addition, we have secured the naming rights to facilities controlled by third parties, such as office towers and a transit center,\\nand any negative events or publicity arising in connection with these facilities could adversely impact our brand.\\nFurther, entry into markets with weaker protection of brands or changes in the legal systems in countries we operate may impact\\nour ability to protect our brands. If we fail to maintain, enhance or protect our brands, or if we incur excessive expenses in our efforts to\\ndo so, our business, operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.\\n20\\nTable of Contents\\nWe are subject to risks associated with our strategic investments, including partial or complete loss of invested capital.\\nSignificant changes in the fair value of this portfolio, including changes in the valuation of our investments in publicly traded and\\nprivately held companies, could negatively impact our financial results.\\nWe have strategic investments in publicly traded and privately held companies in both domestic and international markets,\\nincluding in emerging markets. These companies range from early-stage companies to more mature companies with established\\nrevenue streams and business models. Many such companies generate net losses and the market for their products, services or\\ntechnologies may be slow to develop, and, therefore, they are dependent on the availability of later rounds of financing from banks or\\ninvestors on favorable terms to continue their operations. The financial success of our investment in any privately held company is\\ntypically dependent on a liquidity event, such as a public offering, acquisition or other favorable market event reflecting appreciation to\\nthe cost of our initial investment. Likewise, the financial success of our investment in any publicly held company is typically dependent\\nupon an exit in favorable market conditions, and to a lesser extent on liquidity events. The capital markets for public offerings and\\nacquisitions are dynamic and the likelihood of successful liquidity events for the companies we have invested in could significantly\\nworsen. Further, valuations of privately held companies are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market data.\\nAs the enterprise cloud computing ecosystem has matured, the opportunities in which we can invest have expanded to include\\ninvestments in companies in connection with or as part of such company\\u2019s initial public offering or other transactions directly or\\nindirectly resulting in it being publicly traded. Therefore, our investment strategy and portfolio have also expanded to include public\\ncompanies. In certain cases, our ability to sell these investments may be constrained by contractual obligations to hold the securities for\\na period of time after a public offering, including market standoff agreements and lock-up agreements.\\nWe record all fair value adjustments of our publicly traded and privately held equity investments through the consolidated\\nstatements of operations. As a result, we may experience additional volatility to our statements of operations due to changes in market\\nprices of our investments in publicly held equity investments and the valuation and timing of observable price changes or impairments\\nof our investments in privately held securities. Our ability to mitigate this volatility in any given period may be impacted by our\\ncontractual obligations to hold securities for a set period of time. For example, some of our investments in publicly traded securities\\nmay be subject to lock-up agreements, which would prevent our ability to sell these investments after a public offering or otherwise\\nimpede our ability to mitigate market volatility in such securities. Volatility in the financial markets has in the past and could in the\\nfuture be material to our results in any given quarter and may cause our stock price to decline. While historically our investment\\nportfolio has had a positive impact on our financial results, that may not be true for future periods, particularly in periods of significant\\nmarket fluctuations which affect our strategic investments portfolio.\\nAll of our investments, especially our investments in privately held companies, are subject to a risk of a partial or total loss of\\ninvestment capital. In addition, in the future we may deploy material investments in individual investee companies, resulting in the\\nincreasing concentration of risk in a small number of companies. Changes in the fair value or partial or total loss of investment capital\\nof these individual companies could be material to our financial statements.\\nIf third-party developers and providers do not continue to embrace our technology delivery model and enterprise cloud\\ncomputing services, or if our customers seek warranties from us for third-party applications, integrations, data and content, our\\nbusiness could be harmed.\\nOur success depends on the willingness of a growing community of third-party developers and technology providers to build\\napplications and provide integrations, data and content that are complementary to our services. Without the continued development of\\nthese applications and provision of such integrations, data and content, both current and potential customers may not find our services\\nsufficiently attractive, which could impact future sales. In addition, for those customers who authorize a third-party technology partner\\naccess to their data, we do not provide any warranty related to the functionality, security or integrity of the data access, transmission or\\nprocessing. Despite contract provisions to protect us, customers may look to us to support and provide warranties for the third-party\\napplications, integrations, data and content, even though not developed or sold by us, which may expose us to potential claims,\\nliabilities and obligations, all of which could harm our reputation and our business.\\nSocial and ethical issues, including the use or capabilities of AI in our offerings, may result in reputational harm and liability.\\nPolicies we adopt or choose not to adopt on social and ethical issues, especially regarding the use of our products, may be\\nunpopular with some of our employees or with our customers or potential customers, which has in the past impacted and may in the\\nfuture impact our ability to attract or retain employees and customers. We also may choose not to conduct business with potential\\ncustomers or discontinue or not expand business with existing customers due to these policies. Further, actions taken by our customers\\nand employees, including through the use or misuse of our products or new technologies for illegal activities or improper information\\nsharing, may result in reputational harm or possible liability. For example, we have been subject to allegations in legal proceedings that\\nwe should be liable for the use of certain of our products by third parties. Although we believe that such claims lack merit, these claims\\ncould cause reputational harm to our brand or result in liability.\\n21\\nTable of Contents\\nWe are increasingly building AI into many of our offerings. As with many innovations, AI and our Customer 360 platform present\\nadditional risks and challenges that could affect their adoption and therefore our business. For example, the development of AI and\\nCustomer 360, the latter of which provides information regarding our customers\\u2019 customers, presents emerging ethical issues and if we\\nenable or offer solutions that draw controversy due to their perceived or actual impact on human rights, privacy, employment, or in\\nother social contexts, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm or legal liability. Data practices by us or others\\nthat result in controversy could also impair the acceptance of artificial intelligence solutions. This in turn could undermine the\\ndecisions, predictions or analysis AI applications produce, subjecting us to competitive harm, legal liability and brand or reputational\\nharm.\\nOur aspirations and disclosures related to environmental, social and governance (\\u201cESG\\u201d) matters expose us to risks that could\\nadversely affect our reputation and performance.\\nWe have established and publicly announced ESG goals, including our commitment to advancing racial equality and justice and\\nreducing greenhouse gas emissions. These statements reflect our current plans and aspirations and are not guarantees that we will be\\nable to achieve them. Our failure to accomplish or accurately track and report on these goals on a timely basis, or at all, could adversely\\naffect our reputation, financial performance and growth, and expose us to increased scrutiny from the investment community as well as\\nenforcement authorities.\\nOur ability to achieve any ESG objective is subject to numerous risks, many of which are outside of our control. Examples of\\nsuch risks include:\\n\\u2022 the availability and cost of low- or non-carbon-based energy sources;\\n\\u2022 the evolving regulatory requirements affecting ESG standards or disclosures;\\n\\u2022 the availability of suppliers that can meet our sustainability, diversity and other ESG standards;\\n\\u2022 our ability to recruit, develop and retain diverse talent in our labor markets; and\\n\\u2022 the success of our organic growth and acquisitions or dispositions of businesses or operations.\\nStandards for tracking and reporting ESG matters continue to evolve. Our selection of voluntary disclosure frameworks and\\nstandards, and the interpretation or application of those frameworks and standards, may change from time to time or differ from those\\nof others. This may result in a lack of consistent or meaningful comparative data from period to period or between Salesforce and other\\ncompanies in the same industry. In addition, our processes and controls may not always comply with evolving standards for identifying,\\nmeasuring and reporting ESG metrics, including ESG-related disclosures that may be required of public companies by the Securities\\nExchange Commission, and such standards may change over time, which could result in significant revisions to our current goals,\\nreported progress in achieving such goals, or ability to achieve such goals in the future.\\nIf our ESG practices do not meet evolving investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards, then our reputation, our\\nability to attract or retain employees, and our attractiveness as an investment, business partner, acquiror or service provider could be\\nnegatively impacted. Further, our failure or perceived failure to pursue or fulfill our goals and objectives or to satisfy various reporting\\nstandards on a timely basis, or at all, could have similar negative impacts or expose us to government enforcement actions and private\\nlitigation.\\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\\nPrivacy concerns and laws as well as evolving regulation of cloud computing, cross-border data transfer restrictions and other\\ndomestic or foreign regulations may limit the use and adoption of our services and adversely affect our business.\\nRegulation related to the provision of services over the Internet is evolving, as federal, state and foreign governments continue to\\nadopt new, or modify existing, laws and regulations addressing data privacy, cybersecurity, data protection, data sovereignty and the\\ncollection, processing, storage, transfer and use of data, generally. In some cases, data privacy laws and regulations, such as the\\nEuropean Union\\u2019s (\\u201cEU\\u201d) General Data Protection Regulation (\\u201cGDPR\\u201d), impose obligations directly on Salesforce as both a data\\ncontroller and a data processor, as well as on many of our customers. In addition, new domestic data privacy laws, such as the\\nCalifornia Consumer Privacy Act (\\u201cCCPA\\u201d), the California Privacy Rights Act (\\u201cCPRA\\u201d), which will amend the CCPA in January\\n2023, the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, which also goes into effect in January 2023, and the Colorado Privacy Act, which\\ngoes into effect in July 2023, similarly impose new obligations on us and many of our customers, potentially as both businesses and\\nservice providers. These laws continue to evolve, and as various states introduce similar proposals, we and our customers could be\\nexposed to additional regulatory burdens. Further, laws and legislative proposals such as the EU\\u2019s proposed e-Privacy Regulation are\\nincreasingly aimed at the use of personal information for marketing purposes, and the tracking of individuals\\u2019 online activities.\\nEvolving definitions of what constitutes \\u201cPersonal Information\\u201d and \\u201cPersonal Data\\u201d within the EU, the United States, and elsewhere,\\nespecially relating to classification of IP addresses, machine, or device identification numbers, location data, and other information,\\nfurther enhances the complexity in complying with these regulations across industries and geographies.\\n22\\nTable of Contents\\nAlthough we monitor the regulatory environment and have invested in addressing these developments, these laws may require us\\nto make additional changes to our practices and services to enable us or our customers to meet the new legal requirements, and may\\nalso increase our potential liability exposure through new or higher potential penalties for noncompliance, including as a result of\\npenalties, fines and lawsuits related to data breaches. These new or proposed laws and regulations are subject to differing\\ninterpretations and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions. These and other requirements are causing increased scrutiny amongst\\ncustomers, particularly in the public sector and highly regulated industries, and may be perceived differently from customer to\\ncustomer. These developments could reduce demand for our services, require us to take on more onerous obligations in our contracts,\\nrestrict our ability to store, transfer and process data or, in some cases, impact our ability or our customers' ability to offer our services\\nin certain locations, to deploy our solutions, to reach current and prospective customers, or to derive insights from customer data\\nglobally. For example, on July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union (\\u201cCJEU\\u201d) invalidated the EU-US Privacy Shield\\nFramework, one of the mechanisms that allowed companies, including Salesforce, to transfer personal data from the European\\nEconomic Area (\\u201cEEA\\u201d) to the United States. Depending on how the CJEU\\u2019s decision is enforced, the cost and complexity of providing\\nour services in certain markets may increase. Current indications suggest that, absent agreement on a new bilateral cross-border transfer\\nmechanism to replace the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework, regulators may be inclined to interpret the decision as significantly\\nrestricting certain cross-border transfers. Certain countries outside of the EEA (e.g., Russia, China and India) have also passed or are\\nconsidering passing laws requiring varying degrees of local data residency. By way of further example, statutory damages available\\nthrough a private right of action for certain data breaches under the CCPA, the CPRA and potentially other states\\u2019 laws, may increase\\nour and our customers\\u2019 potential liability and the demands our customers place on us.\\nThe costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, privacy laws, regulations and standards may limit the use and\\nadoption of our services, reduce overall demand for our services, make it more difficult to meet expectations from or commitments to\\ncustomers and our customers\\u2019 customers, lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for noncompliance, impact our reputation, or\\nslow the pace at which we close sales transactions, in particular where customers request specific warranties and unlimited indemnity\\nfor noncompliance with privacy laws, any of which could harm our business. In September 2021, Salesforce announced the Hyperforce\\nEU Operating Zone, which will enable storage and processing of customer data solely within the EU. This new EU service may\\nenhance our ability to attract and retain customers operating in the EU, but may also increase the cost and complexity of supporting\\nthose customers, and our customers may request similar offerings in other territories.\\nIn addition to government activity, privacy advocates and other industry groups have established or may establish new self-\\nregulatory standards that may place additional burdens on our ability to provide our services globally. Our customers expect us to meet\\nvoluntary certification and other standards established by third parties, such as TRUSTe. If we are unable to maintain these\\ncertifications or meet these standards, it could adversely affect our ability to provide our solutions to certain customers and could harm\\nour business. In addition, we have seen a trend toward the private enforcement of data protection obligations, including through private\\nactions for alleged noncompliance, which could harm our business and negatively impact our reputation. For example, in 2020 we were\\nmade a party to a legal proceeding brought by a Dutch privacy advocacy group (the Privacy Collective) on behalf of certain Dutch\\ncitizens that claims we violated the GDPR and Dutch Telecommunications Act through the processing and sharing of data in connection\\nwith our Audience Studio and Data Studio products. In December 2021, the Amsterdam District Court declared the Privacy Collective\\ninadmissible in its claims against us and dismissed the case. We were also named as a defendant in a similar lawsuit brought in the UK.\\nAlthough we believe that these claims lack merit, these or similar future claims could cause reputational harm to our brand or result in\\nliability.\\nFurthermore, the uncertain and shifting regulatory environment and trust climate may raise concerns regarding data privacy and\\ncybersecurity, which may cause our customers or our customers\\u2019 customers to resist providing the data necessary to allow our\\ncustomers to use our services effectively. In addition, new products we develop or acquire (such as Slack) in connection with changing\\nevents may expose us to liability or regulatory risk. Even the perception that the privacy and security of personal information are not\\nsatisfactorily protected or do not meet regulatory requirements could inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit adoption\\nof our cloud-based solutions.\\nIndustry-specific regulations and other requirements and standards are evolving and unfavorable industry-specific laws,\\nregulations, interpretive positions or standards could harm our business.\\nOur customers and potential customers conduct business in a variety of industries, including financial services, the public sector,\\nhealthcare and telecommunications. Regulators in certain industries have adopted and may in the future adopt regulations or\\ninterpretive positions regarding the use of cloud computing and other outsourced services. The costs of compliance with, and other\\nburdens imposed by, industry-specific laws, regulations and interpretive positions may limit our customers\\u2019 use and adoption of our\\nservices and reduce overall demand for our services. Compliance with these regulations may also require us to devote greater resources\\nto support certain customers, which may increase costs and lengthen sales cycles. For example, some financial services regulators have\\nimposed guidelines for use of cloud computing services that mandate specific controls or require financial services enterprises to obtain\\nregulatory approval prior to outsourcing certain functions. In the United States, a cybersecurity Executive Order released in May 2021\\nmay heighten future compliance and\\n23\\nTable of Contents\\nincident reporting standards in order to obtain certain public sector contracts. If we are unable to comply with these guidelines or\\ncontrols, or if our customers are unable to obtain regulatory approval to use our services where required, our business may be harmed.\\nIn addition, an inability to satisfy the standards of certain voluntary third-party certification bodies that our customers may expect, such\\nas an attestation of compliance with the Payment Card Industry (\\u201cPCI\\u201d) Data Security Standards, may have an adverse impact on our\\nbusiness and results. If in the future we are unable to achieve or maintain industry-specific certifications or other requirements or\\nstandards relevant to our customers, it may harm our business and adversely affect our results.\\nFurther, in some cases, industry-specific, regionally-specific or product-specific laws, regulations or interpretive positions may\\nimpact our ability, as well as the ability of our customers, partners and data providers, to collect, augment, analyze, use, transfer and\\nshare personal and other information that is integral to certain services we provide. The interpretation of many of these statutes,\\nregulations and rulings is evolving in the courts and administrative agencies and an inability to comply may have an adverse impact on\\nour business and results. This impact may be particularly acute in countries that have passed or are considering passing legislation that\\nrequires data to remain localized \\u201cin country,\\u201d as this may impose financial costs on companies required to store data in jurisdictions\\nnot of their choosing and to use nonstandard operational processes that add complexity and are difficult and costly to integrate with\\nglobal processes. This is also true with respect to countries that may be considering legal frameworks on artificial intelligence, which is\\na trend that may increase now that the European Commission has proposed the first such framework. Any failure or perceived failure\\nby us to comply with such requirements could have an adverse impact on our business.\\nThere are various statutes, regulations and rulings relevant to the direct email marketing and text-messaging industries, including\\nthe Telephone Consumer Protection Act (\\u201cTCPA\\u201d) and related Federal Communication Commission orders, which impose significant\\nrestrictions on the ability to utilize telephone calls and text messages to mobile telephone numbers as a means of communication, when\\nthe prior consent of the person being contacted has not been obtained. We have been, and may in the future be, subject to one or more\\nclass-action lawsuits, as well as individual lawsuits, containing allegations that one of our businesses or customers violated the TCPA.\\nA determination that we or our customers violated the TCPA or other communications-based statutes could expose us to significant\\ndamage awards that could, individually or in the aggregate, materially harm our business. In addition, many jurisdictions across the\\nworld are currently considering changes to antitrust and competition laws, regulations or interpretative positions to enhance competition\\nin digital markets and address practices by certain digital platforms that they perceive to be anticompetitive. These regulatory efforts\\ncould result in laws, regulations or interpretative positions that may require us to change certain of our business practices, undertake\\nnew compliance obligations or otherwise may have an adverse impact on our business and results.\\nWe have been and may in the future be sued by third parties for various claims, including alleged infringement of proprietary\\nrights.\\nWe are involved in various legal matters arising from the normal course of business activities. These include claims, suits,\\ngovernment investigations and other proceedings involving alleged infringement of third-party patents and other intellectual property\\nrights, as well as commercial, corporate and securities, labor and employment, class actions, wage and hour, antitrust, data privacy and\\nother matters.\\nThe software and Internet industries are characterized by the existence of many patents, trademarks, trade secrets and copyrights\\nand by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We have received in\\nthe past and may receive in the future communications from third parties, including practicing entities and non-practicing entities,\\nclaiming that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. We have also been, and may in the future be, sued by third parties for\\nalleged infringement of their claimed proprietary rights. Our technologies may be subject to injunction if they are found to infringe the\\nrights of a third party or we may be required to pay damages, or both. Further, many of our subscription agreements require us to\\nindemnify our customers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase the cost to us of an adverse\\nruling on such a claim.\\nIn addition, we have in the past been, and may in the future be, sued by third parties who seek to target us for actions taken by our\\ncustomers, including through the use or misuse of our products. For example, we have been subject to allegations in legal proceedings\\nthat we should be liable for the use of certain of our products by third parties. Although we believe that such claims lack merit, such\\nclaims could cause reputational harm to our brand or result in liability.\\nOur exposure to risks associated with various claims, including claims related to the use of intellectual property as well as\\nsecurities and related stockholder derivative claims, may be increased as a result of acquisitions of other companies. For example, we\\nare subject to ongoing securities class action litigation and related stockholder derivative claims brought against Tableau and Slack that\\nremain outstanding, and as to which we may ultimately be subject to liability or settlement costs. Additionally, we may have a lower\\nlevel of visibility into the development process with respect to intellectual property or the care taken to safeguard against infringement\\nrisks with respect to acquired companies or technologies. In addition, third parties have made claims in connection with our\\nacquisitions and may do so in the future, and they may also make infringement and similar or related claims after we have acquired\\ntechnology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition.\\n24\\nTable of Contents\\nThe outcome of any claims or litigation, regardless of the merits, is inherently uncertain. Any claims or lawsuits, and the\\ndisposition of such claims and lawsuits, whether through settlement or licensing discussions, or litigation, could be time-consuming and\\nexpensive to resolve, divert management attention from executing our business plan, result in efforts to enjoin our activities, lead to\\nattempts on the part of other parties to pursue similar claims and, in the case of intellectual property claims, require us to change our\\ntechnology, change our business practices, pay monetary damages or enter into short- or long-term royalty or licensing agreements.\\nAny adverse determination or settlement related to intellectual property claims or other litigation could prevent us from offering\\nour services to others, could be material to our financial condition or cash flows, or both, or could otherwise adversely affect our\\noperating results, including our operating cash flow in a particular period. In addition, depending on the nature and timing of any such\\ndispute, an unfavorable resolution of a legal matter could materially affect our current or future results of operations or cash flows in a\\nparticular period.\\nAny failure to obtain registration or protection of our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our\\nproprietary technology and our brand, causing us to incur significant expenses and harm our business.\\nIf we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our competitors may gain access to our technology, affecting our\\nbrand, causing us to incur significant expenses and harming our business. Any of our patents, trademarks or other intellectual property\\nrights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. While we have many U.S. patents and\\npending U.S. and international patent applications, we may be unable to obtain patent protection for the technology covered in our\\npatent applications or the patent protection may not be obtained quickly enough to meet our business needs. In addition, our existing\\npatents and any patents issued in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages, or may be successfully challenged by third\\nparties. Similar uncertainty applies to our U.S. and international trademark registrations and applications. Furthermore, legal standards\\nrelating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain, and we also may face\\nproposals to change the scope of protection for some intellectual property rights in the U.S. and elsewhere. Effective patent, trademark,\\ncopyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our services are available and legal changes\\nand uncertainty in various countries\\u2019 intellectual property regimes may result in making conduct that we believe is lawful to be deemed\\nviolative of others\\u2019 rights. The laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the\\nU.S., and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate. Also, our involvement in standard-setting\\nactivity, our contribution to open source projects, various competition law regimes or the need to obtain licenses from others may\\nrequire us to license our intellectual property in certain circumstances. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent\\nthird parties from using our intellectual property.\\nWe may be required to spend significant resources and expense to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights. We may\\ninitiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary\\nrights. If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights, it could impact our ability to protect our technology and brand. Furthermore,\\nany litigation, whether or not it is resolved in our favor, could result in significant expense to us, cause us to divert time and resources\\nfrom our core business, and harm our business.\\nWe may be subject to risks related to government contracts and related procurement regulations.\\nOur contracts with federal, state, local and foreign government entities are subject to various procurement regulations and other\\nrequirements relating to their formation, administration and performance. We may be subject to audits and investigations relating to our\\ngovernment contracts, and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including\\ntermination of contracts, refunding or suspending of payments, forfeiture of profits, payment of fines, and suspension or debarment\\nfrom future government business. In addition, such contracts may provide for termination by the government at any time, without\\ncause, and termination of any such contract may adversely impact our other existing or prospective government contracts. Any of these\\nrisks related to contracting with governmental entities could adversely impact our future sales and operating results.\\nWe are subject to governmental sanctions and export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in\\ninternational markets and may subject us to liability if we are not in full compliance with applicable laws.\\nOur solutions are subject to export and import controls where we conduct our business activities, including the U.S. Commerce\\nDepartment\\u2019s Export Administration Regulations, U.S. Customs regulations, U.S. supply chain regulations and various economic and\\ntrade sanctions regulations established by the U.S. Treasury Department\\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control. If we fail to comply with\\napplicable trade laws, we and certain of our employees could be subject to substantial civil or criminal penalties, including the possible\\nloss of trade privileges; fines, which may be imposed on us and responsible employees or managers; and, in extreme cases, the\\nincarceration of responsible employees or managers. Obtaining necessary authorizations, including any required licenses, may be time-\\nconsuming, require expenditure of corporate resources, is not guaranteed, and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities or\\nthe ability to realize value from certain acquisitions or engagements. Furthermore, U.S. export control laws and economic sanctions\\nmay prohibit or limit the transfer of certain\\n25\\nTable of Contents\\nproducts and services to U.S. embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments and parties. Even though we take precautions to prevent\\nour solutions from being provisioned or provided to U.S. sanctions targets in violation of applicable regulations, our solutions could be\\nprovisioned to those targets or provided by our resellers despite such precautions. Any such sales could have negative consequences,\\nincluding government investigations, penalties and reputational harm. Changes in our solutions or changes in trade regulations may\\ncreate delays in the introduction, sale and deployment of our solutions in international markets or prevent the export or import of our\\nsolutions to certain countries, governments or persons altogether. Any decreased use of our solutions or limitation on our ability to\\nexport or sell our solutions may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Import and export control\\nregulations in the U.S. and other countries are subject to change and uncertainty, including as a result of geopolitical developments and\\nrelations between the United States and China, the United States and Russia and Russia\\u2019s recent invasion of Ukraine.\\nFinancial Risks\\nBecause we generally recognize revenue from subscriptions for our services over the term of the subscription, downturns or\\nupturns in new business may not be immediately reflected in our operating results.\\nWe generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription and support agreements, which are\\ntypically 12 to 36 months. As a result, most of the revenue we report in each quarter is the result of subscription and support agreements\\nentered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter may not be reflected\\nin our revenue results for that quarter but will negatively impact our revenue in future quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant\\ndownturns in sales and market acceptance of our services, and changes in our attrition rate, may not be fully reflected in our results of\\noperations until future periods. Our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional\\nsales in any period, as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription and support term.\\nIf we experience significant fluctuations in our rate of anticipated growth and fail to balance our expenses with our revenue\\nforecasts, our business could be harmed and the market price of our common stock could decline.\\nDue to the unpredictability of future general economic and financial market conditions, including from the global economic\\nimpact of Russia\\u2019s recent invasion of Ukraine, the pace of change and innovation in enterprise cloud computing services, the impact of\\nforeign currency exchange rate fluctuations, the growing complexity of our business, including the use of multiple pricing and\\npackaging models and the increasing amount of revenue from software license sales, and our increasing focus on enterprise cloud\\ncomputing services, we may not be able to realize our projected revenue growth plans. We plan our expense and investment levels\\nbased on estimates of future revenue and future anticipated rate of growth. We may not be able to adjust our spending appropriately if\\nthe addition of new subscriptions or the renewals of existing subscriptions fall short of our expectations, and unanticipated events may\\ncause us to incur expenses beyond what we anticipated. A portion of our expenses may also be fixed in nature for some minimum\\namount of time, such as with costs capitalized to obtain revenue contracts, data center and infrastructure service contracts or office\\nleases, so it may not be possible to reduce costs in a timely manner, or at all, without the payment of fees to exit certain obligations\\nearly. As a result, our revenues, operating results and cash flows may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and revenue growth\\nrates may not be sustainable and may decline in the future. In some periods, we have not been able to, and may not be able in the future\\nto provide continued operating margin expansion, which could harm our business and cause the market price of our common stock to\\ndecline.\\nUnanticipated changes in our effective tax rate and additional tax liabilities and global tax developments may impact our\\nfinancial results.\\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and various other jurisdictions. Significant judgment is often required in the\\ndetermination of our worldwide provision for income taxes. Our effective tax rate could be impacted by changes in our earnings and\\nlosses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in operations, changes in non-deductible expenses, changes in excess tax\\nbenefits of stock-based compensation, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and our ability to utilize them, the\\napplicability of withholding taxes, effects from acquisitions, and changes in accounting principles and tax laws. Any changes,\\nambiguity or uncertainty in taxing jurisdictions\\u2019 administrative interpretations, decisions, policies and positions could also materially\\nimpact our income tax liabilities.\\nWe may also be subject to additional tax liabilities and penalties due to changes in non-income based taxes resulting from changes\\nin federal, state, local or international tax laws, changes in taxing jurisdictions\\u2019 administrative interpretations, decisions, policies and\\npositions, results of tax examinations, settlements or judicial decisions, changes in accounting principles, or changes to our business\\noperations, including as a result of acquisitions. Any resulting increase in our tax obligation or cash taxes paid could adversely affect\\nour cash flows and financial results.\\nWe are also subject to tax examinations or engaged in alternative resolutions in multiple jurisdictions. While we regularly evaluate\\nnew information that may change our judgment resulting in recognition, derecognition or changes in measurement of a tax position\\ntaken, there can be no assurance that the final determination of any examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating\\nresults or financial position.\\n26\\nTable of Contents\\nAs our business continues to grow, increasing our brand recognition and profitability, we may be subject to increased scrutiny and\\ncorresponding tax disputes, which may impact our cash flows and financial results. Furthermore, our growing prominence may bring\\npublic attention to our tax profile, and if perceived negatively, may cause brand or reputational harm.\\nAs we utilize our tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards, we may be unable to mitigate our tax obligations to the same\\nextent as in prior years, which could have a material impact to our future cash flows. In addition, changes to our operating structure,\\nincluding changes related to acquisitions, may result in cash tax obligations.\\nGlobal tax developments applicable to multinational businesses may have a material impact to our business, cash flow from\\noperating activities, or financial results. Such developments, for example, may include certain United States\\u2019 proposals as well as the\\nOrganization for Economic Co-operation and Development\\u2019s, the European Commission\\u2019s and certain major jurisdictions\\u2019 heightened\\ninterest in and taxation of companies participating in the digital economy. Furthermore, governments\\u2019 responses to the economic impact\\nof COVID-19 may lead to tax rule changes that could materially and adversely affect our cash flows and financial results.\\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that have in the past and could in the future negatively impact our\\nfinancial results and cash flows from changes in the value of the U.S. Dollar versus local currencies.\\nWe primarily conduct our business in the following regions: the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific. The expanding global scope\\nof our business exposes us to risk of fluctuations in foreign currency markets, including in emerging markets. This exposure is the\\nresult of selling in multiple currencies, growth in our international investments, including data center expansion, additional headcount\\nin foreign locations, and operating in countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Specifically, our results of\\noperations and cash flows are subject to currency fluctuations primarily in Euro, British Pound Sterling, Japanese Yen, Canadian Dollar,\\nAustralian Dollar, Brazilian Real and Israeli Shekel against the U.S. Dollar. These exposures may change over time as business\\npractices evolve, economic and political conditions change and evolving tax regulations come into effect. The fluctuations of currencies\\nin which we conduct business can both increase and decrease our overall revenue and expenses for any given fiscal period.\\nFurthermore, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, combined with the seasonality of our business, could affect our ability to\\naccurately predict our future results and earnings.\\nAdditionally, global events as well as geopolitical developments, including Russia\\u2019s recent invasion of Ukraine, fluctuating\\ncommodity prices, trade tariff developments and inflation have caused, and may in the future cause, global economic uncertainty and\\nuncertainty about the interest rate environment, which could amplify the volatility of currency fluctuations. Although we attempt to\\nmitigate some of this volatility and related risks through foreign currency hedging, our hedging activities are limited in scope and may\\nnot effectively offset the adverse financial impacts that may result from unfavorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates,\\nwhich could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.\\nOur debt service obligations, lease commitments and other contractual obligations may adversely affect our financial\\ncondition, results of operations and cash flows.\\nAs of January 31, 2022, we had a substantial level of outstanding debt, including our Senior Notes and the loan we assumed when\\nwe purchased 50 Fremont. We are also party to the Revolving Loan Credit Agreement, which provides for our $3.0 billion Credit\\nFacility. There were no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility as of January 31, 2022. We may use the proceeds of future\\nborrowings under the Credit Facility for general corporate purposes, which may include, without limitation, financing the consideration\\nfor and fees, costs and expenses related to any acquisition.\\nIn addition to the outstanding and potential debt obligations above, we have also recorded substantial liabilities associated with\\nnoncancellable future payments on our long-term lease agreements. We also have significant other contractual commitments, such as\\ncommitments with infrastructure service providers, which are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets.\\nMaintenance of our indebtedness and contractual commitments and any additional issuances of indebtedness could:\\n\\u2022 impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general\\ncorporate or other purposes;\\n\\u2022 cause us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations toward debt service obligations and principal\\nrepayments; and\\n\\u2022 make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business, our industry or the economy in general.\\nOur ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial,\\nbusiness, economic, regulatory and other factors. We will not be able to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions and\\ngovernmental regulations. Further, our operations may not generate sufficient cash to enable us to service our debt or contractual\\nobligations resulting from our leases. If we fail to make a payment on our debt, we could be in default on such debt. If we are at any\\ntime unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to service our indebtedness when payment is due, we may be required to\\nattempt to renegotiate the terms of the instruments relating to the indebtedness,\\n27\\nTable of Contents\\nseek to refinance all or a portion of the indebtedness or obtain additional financing. There can be no assurance that we would be able to\\nsuccessfully renegotiate such terms, that any such refinancing would be possible or that any additional financing could be obtained on\\nterms that are favorable or acceptable to us. Any new or refinanced debt may be subject to substantially higher interest rates, which\\ncould adversely affect our financial condition and impact our business. In addition, we may seek debt financing to fund future\\nacquisitions. We can offer no assurance that we can obtain debt financing on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\\nIn addition, adverse changes by any rating agency to our credit facilities may negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our\\ndebt and equity securities, as well as the potential costs associated with a refinancing of our debt. Downgrades in our credit ratings\\ncould also affect the terms of any such refinancing or future financing or restrict our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.\\nThe indentures governing our Senior Notes and the Revolving Loan Credit Agreement impose restrictions on us and require us to\\nmaintain compliance with specified covenants. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our\\ncontrol. A failure to comply with the covenants and other provisions of our outstanding debt could result in events of default under such\\ninstruments, which could permit acceleration of all of our debt and borrowings. Any required repayment of our debt as a result of a\\nfundamental change or other acceleration would lower our current cash on hand such that we would not have those funds available for\\nuse in our business.\\nLease accounting guidance requires that we record a liability for operating lease activity on our consolidated balance sheet, which\\nincreases both our assets and liabilities and therefore may impact our ability to obtain the necessary financing from financial institutions\\nat commercially viable rates or at all. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease. Periods beyond the\\nnoncancellable term of the lease are included in the measurement of the lease liability and associated asset only when it is reasonably\\ncertain that we will exercise the associated extension option or waive the termination option. We reassess the lease term if and when a\\nsignificant event or change in circumstances occurs within our control. The potential impact of these options to extend could be\\nmaterial to our financial position and financial results.\\nCurrent and future accounting pronouncements and other financial and nonfinancial reporting standards may negatively\\nimpact our financial results.\\nWe regularly monitor our compliance with applicable financial and nonfinancial reporting standards and review new\\npronouncements and interpretations that are relevant to us. As a result of new standards, changes to existing standards and changes in\\ntheir interpretation, we may be required to change our accounting policies, to alter our operational policies, to implement new or\\nenhance existing systems so that they reflect new or amended financial reporting standards, and to adjust our published financial\\nstatements. For example, as we work to align with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures\\n(TCFD) and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Standards, we have revised and expanded, and may continue to\\nrevise and expand, our disclosures in these areas. Such changes may have an adverse effect on our business, financial position and\\noperating results, or cause an adverse deviation from our revenue and operating profit targets, which may negatively impact our\\nfinancial results.\\nRisks Related to Owning Our Common Stock\\nOur quarterly results are likely to fluctuate, which may cause the value of our common stock to decline substantially.\\nOur quarterly results are likely to fluctuate. Fluctuations have occurred due to known and unknown risks, including the sudden\\nand unanticipated effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, our fiscal fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter\\nfor new business and renewals, and the year-over-year compounding effect of this seasonality in billing patterns and overall new\\nbusiness and renewal activity causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter to continually increase in proportion to\\nour billings in the other three quarters of our fiscal year. As a result, our fiscal first quarter has typically in the past been our largest\\ncollections and operating cash flow quarter.\\nAdditionally, some of the important factors that may cause our revenues, operating results and cash flows to fluctuate from\\nquarter to quarter include:\\n\\u2022 general economic or geopolitical conditions, including the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia\\u2019s recent invasion of\\nUkraine, which can adversely affect either our customers\\u2019 ability or willingness to purchase additional subscriptions or\\nupgrade their services, or delay

implementations.\\nMany of these factors are outside of our control, and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our operating results to\\nvary widely. If we fail to meet or exceed operating results expectations or if securities analysts and investors have estimates and\\nforecasts of our future performance that are unrealistic or that we do not meet, the market price of our common stock could decline. In\\naddition, if one or more of the securities analysts who cover us adversely change their recommendations regarding our stock, the\\nmarket price of our common stock could decline.\\nThe market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could subject us to litigation.\\nThe trading prices of the securities of technology companies have historically been highly volatile. Accordingly, the market price\\nof our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations. Factors affecting the market price of our\\ncommon stock include:\\n\\u2022 variations in our operating results, earnings per share, cash flows from operating activities, unearned revenue, remaining\\nperformance obligation, year-over-year growth rates for individual service offerings and other financial and non-financial\\nmetrics, and how those results compare to analyst expectations;\\n\\u2022 variations in, and limitations of, the various financial and other metrics and modeling used by analysts in their research and\\nreports about our business;\\n\\u2022 forward-looking guidance to industry and financial analysts related to, for example, future revenue, current remaining\\nperformance obligation, cash flows from operating activities and earnings per share, the accuracy of which may be impacted\\nby various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including general economic and market conditions and\\nunanticipated delays in the integration of acquired companies as a result of regulatory review;\\n\\u2022 our ability to meet or exceed forward-looking guidance we have given or to meet or exceed the expectations of investors,\\nanalysts or others; our ability to give forward-looking guidance consistent with past practices; and changes to or withdrawal of\\nprevious guidance or long-range targets;\\n\\u2022 changes in the estimates of our operating results or changes in recommendations by securities analysts that elect to follow our\\ncommon stock;\\n\\u2022 announcements of technological innovations, new services or service enhancements, strategic alliances or significant\\nagreements by us or by our competitors;\\n\\u2022 announcements by us or by our competitors of mergers or other strategic acquisitions, or rumors of such transactions involving\\nus or our competitors;\\n\\u2022 announcements of customer additions and customer cancellations or delays in customer purchases;\\n\\u2022 the coverage of our common stock by the financial media, including television, radio and press reports and blogs;\\n\\u2022 recruitment or departure of key personnel;\\n\\u2022 disruptions in our service due to computer hardware, software, network or data center problems;\\n\\u2022 the economy as a whole, geopolitical conditions, including global trade and health concerns, market conditions in our industry\\nand the industries of our customers;\\n\\u2022 trading activity by a limited number of stockholders who together beneficially own a significant portion of our outstanding\\ncommon stock;\\n\\u2022 the issuance of shares of common stock by us, whether in connection with an acquisition or a capital-raising transaction;\\n\\u2022 issuance of debt or other convertible securities;\\n\\u2022 the inability to conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective;\\n\\u2022 changes to our credit ratings; and\\n\\u2022 ESG and other issues impacting our reputation.\\nIn addition, if the market for technology stocks or the greater securities market in general experience uneven investor confidence,\\nthe market price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, operating results or financial condition. The\\nmarket price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies within, or outside, our industry\\neven if these events do not directly affect us. Some companies that have experienced volatility in the trading price of their stock have\\nbeen the subject of securities class action litigation, such as the securities litigation against Tableau and Slack that were brought before\\nwe acquired such companies. Such litigation, whether against Salesforce or an acquired subsidiary, could result in substantial costs and\\na diversion of management\\u2019s attention and resources and liability resulting from or the settlement of such litigation could result in\\nmaterial adverse impacts to our operating cash flows or results of operations for a given period.\\n30\\nTable of Contents\\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law might discourage, delay or\\nprevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the market price of our common\\nstock.\\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the market price of our\\ncommon stock by acting to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the\\nstockholders of our company may deem advantageous. These provisions among other things:\\n\\u2022 permit the board of directors to establish the number of directors;\\n\\u2022 authorize the issuance of \\u201cblank check\\u201d preferred stock that our board could use to implement a stockholder rights plan (also\\nknown as a \\u201cpoison pill\\u201d);\\n\\u2022 prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our\\nstockholders;\\n\\u2022 provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws; and\\n\\u2022 establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted\\nupon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings.\\nIn addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our\\ncompany. Section 203 imposes certain restrictions on merger, business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of\\n15 percent or more of our common stock.\\nGeneral Risks\\nThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and related public health measures have materially affected how we and our customers\\nare operating our businesses, and have in the past materially affected our operating results and cash flows; the duration and extent\\nto which this will impact our future results of operations and cash flows remain uncertain.\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and related public health measures have materially affected how we and our customers are operating\\nour businesses, and have in the past materially affected our operating results and cash flows; the duration and extent to which this will\\nimpact our future results remain uncertain. We have in the past and may in the future deem it advisable to alter, postpone or cancel\\nentirely additional customer, employee and industry events.\\nIn March 2020, we also temporarily closed all Salesforce offices globally. This global work-from-home operating environment\\nhas caused strain for, and has adversely impacted productivity of, certain employees, and these conditions may persist and harm our\\nbusiness, including our future sales and operating results. As long as the pandemic continues, our employees may be exposed to health\\nrisks and government directives may require us to again close certain of our offices that have since been reopened. Changes in our work\\nenvironment and workforce in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic could also adversely affect our operations. In particular, although\\nmost of our offices have reopened, we have offered a significant percentage of our employees the flexibility in the amount of time they\\nwork in an office. This may present risks for our real estate portfolio and strategy and may present operational and workplace culture\\nchallenges that may adversely affect our business.\\nOur operations have been negatively affected by a range of external factors related to the COVID-19 pandemic that are not within\\nour control, and COVID-19 cases (including the spread of variants or mutant strains) continue to surge in certain parts of the world,\\nwhich could impact the operations of our business infrastructure and service providers in such parts of the world and delay our security\\nmeasures, business processes, product development and foreign investments. Authorities throughout the world have implemented\\nnumerous preventative measures to contain or mitigate further spread of the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, limitations on\\nbusiness activity, quarantines and shelter-in-place orders. These public health measures have caused, and are continuing to cause,\\nbusiness slowdowns or shutdowns in affected areas, both regionally and worldwide, which have impacted our business and results of\\noperations and cash flows. As we continue to monitor the situation and public health guidance throughout the world, we may adjust our\\ncurrent policies and practices, and existing and new precautionary measures could negatively affect our operations.\\nThe long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our financial condition or results of operations remains uncertain. Due to\\nour subscription-based business model, the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic may not be fully reflected in our results of operations\\nuntil future periods. If the COVID-19 pandemic has a substantial impact on our customers\\u2019 business or the productivity of our\\nemployees or partners, our results of operations and overall financial performance may be harmed. The global macroeconomic effects\\nof the COVID-19 pandemic and related impacts on our customers\\u2019 business operations and their demand for our products and services\\nmay persist for an indefinite period, even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided. In addition, the effects of the COVID-19\\npandemic may heighten other risks described in this \\u201cRisk Factors\\u201d section.\\n31\\nTable of Contents\\nVolatile and significantly weakened global economic conditions have in the past and may in the future adversely affect our\\nindustry, business and results of operations.\\nOur overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic and geopolitical conditions. The United States and other key\\ninternational economies have experienced significant economic and market downturns in the past, and are likely to experience\\nadditional cyclical downturns from time to time in which economic activity is impacted by falling demand for a variety of goods and\\nservices, restricted credit, poor liquidity, reduced corporate profitability, volatility in credit, equity and foreign exchange markets,\\ninflation, bankruptcies and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy. These economic conditions can arise suddenly, as did the\\nconditions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, and the full impact of such conditions can be difficult to predict. In addition,\\ngeopolitical and domestic political developments, such as existing and potential trade wars and other events beyond our control, such as\\nRussia\\u2019s recent invasion of Ukraine, can increase levels of political and economic unpredictability globally and increase the volatility of\\nglobal financial markets. Moreover, these conditions have affected and may continue to affect the rate of IT spending; could adversely\\naffect our customers\\u2019 ability or willingness to attend our events or to purchase our enterprise cloud computing services; have delayed\\nand may delay customer purchasing decisions; have reduced and may in the future reduce the value and duration of customer\\nsubscription contracts; and we expect these conditions will adversely affect our customer attrition rates. All of these risks and\\nconditions could materially adversely affect our future sales and operating results.\\nNatural disasters and other events beyond our control have in the past and may in the future materially adversely affect us.\\nNatural disasters or other catastrophic events have in the past and may in the future cause damage or disruption to our operations,\\ninternational commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a strong negative effect on us. Our business operations are subject\\nto interruption by natural disasters, fire, power shutoffs or shortages, actual or threatened public health emergencies (including the\\nongoing COVID-19 pandemic) and other events beyond our control. Although we maintain crisis management and disaster response\\nplans, such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers, and could decrease demand for\\nour services. Our corporate headquarters, and a significant portion of our personnel, research and development activities, IT systems\\nand other critical business operations, are located near major seismic faults in the San Francisco Bay Area. Because we do not carry\\nearthquake insurance for direct earthquake-related losses, with the exception of the building that we own in San Francisco, and\\nsignificant recovery time could be required to resume operations, our financial condition and operating results could be materially\\nadversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or catastrophic event, and the adverse effects of any such catastrophic event\\nwould be exacerbated if experienced at the same time as another unexpected and adverse event. For example, wildfires have resulted in\\npower shut-offs in the San Francisco Bay Area and are likely to occur in the future, and this could adversely affect the work-from-home\\noperations of our employees in the San Francisco Bay Area.\\nClimate change may have an impact on our business.\\nWhile we seek to mitigate our business risks associated with climate change by establishing robust environmental programs and\\npartnering with organizations who are also focused on mitigating their own climate-related risks, we recognize that there are inherent\\nclimate-related risks wherever business is conducted. Any of our primary locations may be vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate\\nchange. For example, our offices globally have historically experienced, and are projected to continue to experience, climate-related\\nevents at an increasing frequency, including drought, water scarcity, heat waves, cold waves, wildfires and resultant air quality impacts\\nand power shutoffs associated with wildfire prevention. Furthermore, it is more difficult to mitigate the impact of these events on our\\nemployees to the extent they work from home. Changing market dynamics, global policy developments and the increasing frequency\\nand impact of extreme weather events on critical infrastructure in the U.S. and elsewhere have the potential to disrupt our business, the\\nbusiness of our third-party suppliers and the business of our customers, and may cause us to experience higher attrition, losses and\\nadditional costs to maintain or resume operations. Additionally, failure to uphold, meet or make timely forward progress against our\\npublic commitments and goals related to climate action could adversely affect our reputation with suppliers and customers, financial\\nperformance or ability to recruit and retain talent.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Summary\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2147,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The text discusses the disclosure of principal accountant fees and services, directing readers to refer to the Proxy Statement for more information, including details on the ratification of the appointment of independent auditors.\",\n          \"The text provides an overview of the Management\\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for T-Mobile US, Inc.
